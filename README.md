# CMSC 215: Intermediate Java Programming

Welcome to the repository for my coursework in **CMSC 215: Intermediate Programming in Java** at the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC). This repository showcases my progress in mastering intermediate-level programming concepts and implementing Java projects, with the ultimate goal of applying these skills in a professional software engineering role.

## üìö Course Overview
This course builds upon foundational programming knowledge and emphasizes object-oriented programming, graphical user interface (GUI) development, exception handling, recursion, and data structures. Key focus areas include:
- Object-oriented design and programming
- GUI and event-driven programming
- Exception handling, I/O operations, and recursion
- Generics, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Abstraction and interfaces

## üéØ Course Outcomes
Upon completion, I will have demonstrated the ability to:
- Design and implement object-oriented programs using Java features like classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces.
- Simplify complex programming problems through object-oriented approaches.
- Handle exceptions effectively and implement robust file I/O solutions.
- Create interactive GUIs with user-interface controls, event handlers, and animations.
- Utilize recursive programming techniques and apply generics in classes and methods.
- Document the design, implementation, and testing processes for Java applications.
